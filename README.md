# Where do I Start?

Climate change is here, it may not have significantly changed your life yet, but it is increasingly effecting people around the world and it's only a matter of time before it knocks on your door, floods your basement, tears your roof away, or empties your pantry. Ok, I know that may alarming, however, I'm not here to be a doomsayer, I'm simply here to share my journey of adapting my lifestyle to a world were climate change is a reality, sharing the resources, communities and knowledge I come across in the hopes that others can adapt, learn and grow with me in these uncertain times.

That's what I'd like to stress the most, times are uncertain, I'm not here to prove to you climate change is real, but even if you don't think it is, what harm is there in building a more resilient lifestyle, household, community or city? Being prepared means considering possibilities, however remote you may think they are and having a plan, you may never need to execute that plan, but you'll sleep sounder for having it. This resource for me presents a way of bleeding away my anxiety, not compounding it, I hope it does the same for you. :\)

 So, you got this far, where do you start? How do become more resilient? How do you adapt to a changing world? Well, I'm still trying to figure that out myself, and for that reason, this resource will never be complete. It starts today with me sharing it with you along with some good reads, amazing communities you can join and some thoughts on my next steps. I'd say the first thing you should do is check out [The Resilience Checklist](resources/the-resilience-checklist.md), figure out what area you feel you're weakest in, start researching there and come back here to [Contribute](contribute.md) your findings.
