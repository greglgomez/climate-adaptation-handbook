# Future Sections

Below are future content sections I plan to include in this guide, in no particular order. These themes are largely based on the categories found in the [Resilience Checklist](resources/the-resilience-checklist.md), which itself is based on the work from folks over at [PeakProsperity](https://www.peakprosperity.com/).

* Physical Wellbeing
* Emotional Resilience
* Building Communities
* Practical Skills
* Food
* Water
* Shelter
* Energy
* Transportation
* Finance

This is an open source project, any one can [Contribute](contribute.md), so get involved!
