# Where do I start?

OK, so I have your interest, you probably want to know where do you start? 

_How do I become more resilient?_ 

_How do I adapt to a changing world?_ 

_How do I tell my children?_

Well, I'm still trying to figure that out myself, and for that reason, this resource will never be complete. It starts today with me sharing it with you along with some good reads, amazing communities you can join and some thoughts on next steps. I'd say the first thing you should do is check out [The Resilience Checklist](resources/the-resilience-checklist.md), figure out what area you feel you're weakest in, start researching there and come back here to [Contribute](contribute.md) your findings. :\)
